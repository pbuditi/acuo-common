/**
 * Captures a provider from a binder for later use. This allows you to create a
 * Provider for something before you've run your module's configure() or have a
 * reference to the resulting Injector. The provider will only work once the
 * injector has been created, naturally.
 *
 * Binders will let you get a provider for a key, but that's only possible at
 * module configuration time. This wrapper class allows you to effectively save
 * a provider for something at module construction time.
 *
 * To use, call saveProvider on your instance inside your module's configure()
 * method, and pass the instance around wherever you need the relevant Provider.
 * It simply proxies the binder's Provider, so it will obey the same scoping,
 * etc.
 *
 * It saves the provider to a volatile field, so you can safely use this
 * Provider in threads other than the one that ran the module configure()
 * method. However, this class is really just designed for working around
 * awkward chicken-and-egg problems while initializing a system, so if you find
 * yourself using it beyond that, are you sure you can't just inject things
 * normally into whatever you're currently passing this Provider implementation
 * to?
